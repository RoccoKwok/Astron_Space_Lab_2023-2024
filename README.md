This is a program that calculate the velocity of a satellite by combining the *photo capturing and 3-axis accelerometer*.
It used photo capturing to take some photos on the ISS(International Space Station). By calculating their distance difference in pixel, we can get the estimated velocity with a certain time.
Beside, it also used 3-axis accelerometer to find the linear acceleration of the ISS(International Space Station) which calculated by calculus and matrix.
By combining them in one system, it can significantly decrease the error of miscalculating in *0.1%*.
